# ðŸ“– Reading Files in Java

Reading data from files is one of the most common and useful operations in Java.
Whether youâ€™re reading configuration data, user input, or large text files, Java provides efficient tools for handling file input safely and effectively.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

### **1. FileReader**

* Used for reading **character data** from text files.
* Reads one character at a time or into a character array.
* Slower for large files because it doesnâ€™t use buffering internally.

---

### **2. BufferedReader**

* Wraps around `FileReader` to improve performance.
* Reads large chunks of data at once using an internal buffer.
* Provides convenient methods like `readLine()` for reading full lines easily.

ðŸ“˜ **Syntax:**

```java
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
```

---

### **3. Why Use Buffering?**

Without buffering:

* Each `read()` call accesses the disk directly â†’ **slow**.

With buffering:

* Data is read into memory in chunks â†’ **fast and efficient**.

Hence, we typically use:

```java
new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))
```

instead of just `new FileReader("file.txt")`.

### **4. Common Exceptions**

| Exception               | Description                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FileNotFoundException` | Thrown if the file doesnâ€™t exist or canâ€™t be opened.             |
| `IOException`           | Thrown for general input/output errors (like permission issues). |

Always use **try-with-resources** to automatically close the file after reading.

---

### **5. Reading Line by Line**

Reading files line by line is efficient for text data like logs, CSVs, or configuration files.

ðŸ“˜ **Example pattern:**

```java
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("data.txt"))) 
{
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) 
    {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
} 
catch (IOException e) 
{
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## ðŸ§  Summary

âœ… Use **FileReader** for basic character input.
âœ… Wrap it with **BufferedReader** for efficiency.
âœ… Always handle **FileNotFoundException** and **IOException**.
âœ… Prefer **try-with-resources** to auto-close readers.
âœ… Read **line by line** when working with text data.
